The app naps between checks, so you won’t notice it while playing.' },
      { q: 'WHAT IF MY CO-OP PARTNER OVERWRITES MY UPLOAD?', a: 'They can’t, on purpose. Only the person holding the lock can upload. To push their version they have to take the lock first — which warns you, and goes in the logbook for all to see. Worst case, your version is one Restore away in the history.' },

A typical co-op group saves {0} compared to renting a 24/7 server that sits idle 18 hours a day.' },
      { q: 'DOES THIS WORK FOR EMULATORS OR CONSOLE SAVES?', a: 'Emulators, absolutely — RetroArch, Dolphin, PCSX2, DuckStation, PPSSPP, RPCS3, and Cemu all have presets, so your save states finally get real version history. Console saves only work if you can get them onto a PC first. The app itself runs on Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Linux.' },
