It checks the folder every 60 seconds; if the game is mid-save it waits for things to go quiet and tries again — no broken files, no stutter. The app naps between checks, so you won’t notice it while playing.' },
      { q: 'WHAT IF MY CO-OP PARTNER OVERWRITES MY UPLOAD?', a: 'They can’t, on purpose. Only the person holding the lock can upload. To push their version they have to take the lock first — which warns you, and goes in the logbook for all to see. Worst case, your version is one Restore away in the history.' },
      { q: 'DO I STILL NEED A DEDICATED SERVER?', a: 'For most groups, no. The whole point of a dedicated server is keeping your world online when the host’s PC is off. Checkpoint64 covers about 90% of that for a one-time fee: whoever wants to play grabs the lock, plays their session, then pushes the save back. A typical co-op group saves {0} compared to renting a 24/7 server that sits idle 18 hours a day.' },
      { q: 'DOES THIS WORK FOR EMULATORS OR CONSOLE SAVES?', a: 'Emulators, absolutely — RetroArch, Dolphin, PCSX2, DuckStation, PPSSPP, RPCS3, and Cemu all have presets, so your save states finally get real version history. Console saves only work if you can get them onto a PC first. The app itself runs on Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Linux.' },
      { q: 'WHAT DOES IT COST?', a: 'The free plan is real and stays free: 20 MiB, your own space plus one team. Lifetime is a one-time payment — 1 GiB per space, up to 3 teams, bought direct or through Steam. Pro is for big crews: 5 GiB per space, 5 teams, 25 seats each, unlimited read-only share codes. Share codes themselves work on every plan — Free hosts 3 read-only fans at a time, Lifetime 15. No charge per person on any tier.' },
      { q: 'CAN I USE IT TODAY?', a: 'Yes — v1.0 is out. It’s a free download for Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Linux, and it’s on Steam too.' },
      { q: 'WHO CAN SEE MY SAVES?', a: 'Your teammates — and only the ones you invite. They see your display name, never your email. And your data stays yours: export everything as a zip whenever you like, and deleting your account actually deletes it (after a 7-day cooling-off period, in case of 2am regret).' },
      { q: 'IS THE FREE PLAN A TRIAL?', a: 'No. It has no timer and no card on file. 20 MiB is small on purpose — enough for Stardew, Hollow Knight, or a whole retro library — and it never expires.' },
      { q: 'IS PRO A SUBSCRIPTION?', a: 'Bought direct, yes — monthly, cancel anytime. On Steam, Pro is a one-time unlock; there are no subscriptions of any kind on Steam.' },

    faq: [
      { q: "What counts as a 'save'?", a: 'Whatever your game writes to your hard drive. Checkpoint64 treats the files in a folder as one save and backs them up together. Presets for 140+ games (and seven emulators) set this up for you; for anything else, point at the folder and pick the files yourself.' },
      { q: 'Do you upload while the game is running?', a: "Yes, carefully. Checkpoint64 never locks your save files. It checks the folder every 60 seconds; if the game is mid-save it waits for things to go quiet and tries again — no broken files, no stutter. The app naps between checks, so you won't notice it while playing." },
      { q: 'What if my co-op partner overwrites my upload?', a: "They can't, on purpose. Only the person holding the lock can upload. To push their version they have to take the lock first — which warns you, and goes in the logbook for all to see. Worst case, your version is one Restore away in the history." },
      { q: 'Do I still need a dedicated server?', a: "For most groups, no. The whole point of a dedicated server is keeping your world online when the host's PC is off. Checkpoint64 covers about 90% of that for a one-time fee: whoever wants to play grabs the lock, plays their session, then pushes the save back. A typical co-op group saves {0} compared to renting a 24/7 server that sits idle 18 hours a day." },

Console saves only work if you can get them onto a PC first. The app itself runs on Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon), and Linux.' },
